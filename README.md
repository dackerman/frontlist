# Frontlist landing page

This is an example landing page for an idea I had for a product called
"frontlist". Frontlist is basically a CRM tool in the same vein as
WordPress but with components built out so the user has less choices
to make regarding layout (but still has a chance to make it unique).

This particular page is just a simple example of using React to build
a webpage, using webpack, ES2015 JS, and other modern development
practices.

### Running

1. `npm install`
1. `./node_modules/.bin/webpack`
1. `open ./builds/index.html`
